        title: "The Road Not Taken",
        author: "Robert Frost",
        excerpt: "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood...",
        content: `Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
                And sorry I could not travel both
                And be one traveler, long I stood
                And looked down one as far as I could
                To where it bent in the undergrowth;

                Then took the other, as just as fair,
                And having perhaps the better claim,
                Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
                Though as for that the passing there
                Had worn them really about the same,

                And both that morning equally lay
                In leaves no step had trodden black.
                Oh, I kept the first for another day!
                Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
                I doubted if I should ever come back.

                I shall be telling this with a sigh
                Somewhere ages and ages hence:
                Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
                I took the one less traveled by,
                And that has made all the difference.`

        excerpt: "I wandered lonely as a cloud...",
        content: `I wandered lonely as a cloud
                That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
                When all at once I saw a crowd,
                A host, of golden daffodils;
                Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
                Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

                Continuous as the stars that shine
                And twinkle on the milky way,
                They stretched in never-ending line
                Along the margin of a bay:
                Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
                Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.`

        content: `I met a traveller from an antique land,
                Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
                Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
                Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,

                And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
                Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
                Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
                The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;

                And on the pedestal, these words appear:
                My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
                Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
                Nothing beside remains. Round the decay

                Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
                The lone and level sands stretch far away.”`

        excerpt: "She walks in beauty, like the night...",
        content: `She walks in beauty, like the night
            Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
            And all that’s best of dark and bright
            Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
            Thus mellowed to that tender light
            Which heaven to gaudy day denies.

            One shade the more, one ray the less,
            Had half impaired the nameless grace
            Which waves in every raven tress,
            Or softly lightens o’er her face;
            Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
            How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.`

        content: `Tyger Tyger, burning bright,
        In the forests of the night;
        What immortal hand or eye,
        Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

        In what distant deeps or skies.
        Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
        On what wings dare he aspire?
        What the hand, dare seize the fire?`

        content: `Hope is the thing with feathers
                That perches in the soul,
                And sings the tune without the words,
                And never stops at all,

                And sweetest in the Gale is heard;
                And sore must be the storm
                That could abash the little Bird
                That kept so many warm.

                I’ve heard it in the chillest land,
                And on the strangest Sea;
                Yet, never, in Extremity,
                It asked a crumb of Me.`
