        excerpt: "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood...",
        content: "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,\nAnd sorry I could not travel both\nAnd be one traveler, long I stood\nAnd looked down one as far as I could\nTo where it bent in the undergrowth;\n\nThen took the other, as just as fair,\nAnd having perhaps the better claim,\nBecause it was grassy and wanted wear;\nThough as for that the passing there\nHad worn them really about the same,\n\nAnd both that morning equally lay\nIn leaves no step had trodden black.\nOh, I kept the first for another day!\nYet knowing how way leads on to way,\nI doubted if I should ever come back.\n\nI shall be telling this with a sigh\nSomewhere ages and ages hence:\nTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I—\nI took the one less traveled by,\nAnd that has made all the difference."

        excerpt: "I wandered lonely as a cloud...",
        content: "I wandered lonely as a cloud\nThat floats on high o'er vales and hills,\nWhen all at once I saw a crowd,\nA host, of golden daffodils;\nBeside the lake, beneath the trees,\nFluttering and dancing in the breeze.\n\nContinuous as the stars that shine\nAnd twinkle on the milky way,\nThey stretched in never-ending line\nAlong the margin of a bay:\nTen thousand saw I at a glance,\nTossing their heads in sprightly dance."

        author: "Percy Bysshe Shelley",
        excerpt: "I met a traveller from an antique land...",
        content: "I met a traveller from an antique land,\nWho said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\nStand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,\nHalf sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\nThe hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\nAnd on the pedestal, these words appear:\nMy name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;\nLook on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!\nNothing beside remains. Round the decay\nOf that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.”"

        author: "Lord Byron",
        excerpt: "She walks in beauty, like the night...",
        content: "She walks in beauty, like the night\nOf cloudless climes and starry skies;\nAnd all that’s best of dark and bright\nMeet in her aspect and her eyes;\nThus mellowed to that tender light\nWhich heaven to gaudy day denies.\n\nOne shade the more, one ray the less,\nHad half impaired the nameless grace\nWhich waves in every raven tress,\nOr softly lightens o’er her face;\nWhere thoughts serenely sweet express,\nHow pure, how dear their dwelling-place."

        content: "Tyger Tyger, burning bright,\nIn the forests of the night;\nWhat immortal hand or eye,\nCould frame thy fearful symmetry?\n\nIn what distant deeps or skies.\nBurnt the fire of thine eyes?\nOn what wings dare he aspire?\nWhat the hand, dare seize the fire?"

        author: "Emily Dickinson",
        excerpt: "That perches in the soul...",
        content: "Hope is the thing with feathers\nThat perches in the soul,\nAnd sings the tune without the words,\nAnd never stops at all,\n\nAnd sweetest in the Gale is heard;\nAnd sore must be the storm\nThat could abash the little Bird\nThat kept so many warm.\n\nI’ve heard it in the chillest land,\nAnd on the strangest Sea;\nYet, never, in Extremity,\nIt asked a crumb of Me."
